# Neural-Network-CNN-Potato-leaf-disease-prediction-
By using (import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import os
import cv2
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split) build the model.
Data sourced from Kaggle.
The main object of the project is to predict with images using CNN the potato leaf are normal disease, fully disease or healthy.
Using total 1152 Images the model is build.
Using CNN model got accuracy 86%.
